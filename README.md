This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

This project was developed as part of the challenge presented by Modak for their selection process. It was built using the following technologies:

- React Native CLI
- React Query
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- React Navigation


I successfully implemented all the basic features, as well as some of the bonus features (such as deep linking and a native module) for the Android version of the app. For testing purposes, I recommend running the Android version. I’ve included a link to the most recently generated APK in case the reviewer is unable to run the app locally. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, feedback, or suggestions!


# How to run the project (ProductsApp)

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Set node version

First, you will need to run nvm to specify the right node version to run the project (wich is 20).

## Step 2: Start Metro

Second, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio.
